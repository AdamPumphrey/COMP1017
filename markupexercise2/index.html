			This weeks featured game is Dark Souls III a game of valleys and
			peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a
			plummet into places we shouldn't be, an escape from places we
			don't belong.

			But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our
			way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end,
			Dark Souls III is well worth the riveting climb. Final Fantasy 15
			will launch on September 30, 2016 publisher Square Enix has
			announced. The date was revealed during the Uncovered: Final
			Fantasy XV event, which is being held in Los Angeles.
