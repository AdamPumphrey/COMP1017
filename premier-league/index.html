				<h2>Leagues</h2>
				<p>
					We offer both classic and head to head leagues, as well as
					private and public leagues.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Classic Leagues:</dt>
						<dd>
							In classic leagues teams are ranked based on the
							total number of points scored by their players
							throughout the season.
						</dd>
					<dt>Head to Head Leagues:</dt>
						<dd>
							In head to head leagues each team plays against
							another opponent each week of the season. Just like
							the Premier League, a win is worth 3 points, a draw
							is worth 1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points.
						</dd>
					<dt>Private Leagues</dt>
						<dd>
							Private leagues work the same way as public leagues
							except they require a password to join them.
							Private leagues also allow the league creator to
							manually start the draft with the click of a
							button. Public leagues start automatically at a
							given date. Also, settings for private leagues can
							be changed before the draft starts, whereas the
							settings in public leagues can't be changed.

				<h2>Picking a Well Balanced Team</h2>
				<p>
					This refers to both price and teams.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Teams:</dt>
						<dd>
							Selecting your FPL team from a range of teams
							ensures you are well covered in the event that one
							side does particularly well or badly in any given
							weekend.
						</dd>
					<dt>Price:</dt>
						<dd>
							Ensure that the selection of 1-3 high price players
							is not at the expense of the rest of your team. It
							is important that not only 1-3 players are relied
							upon to score all of your points. If there is an
							injury, or if the players form drops, it can hurt
							your points in a big way.
