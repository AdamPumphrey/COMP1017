					Everything in Star Wars has a story. Every character, every
					weapon, every planet, and every ship helps form one of the
					most involved taxonomies of any cinematic universe.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, for someone unfamiliar with the series, this can
					make enjoying the franchise feel like an intimidating or
					impossible task. This website is a brief primer for anyone
					who would like to enjoy the films, but isn’t sure where or
					how to start.

				<h2>The Three Trilogies</h2>
				<p>
					Over the past 40 years, Star Wars has spawned countless
					comic books, audio dramas, television series,
					novelisations, video games, and more. Instead of
					cataloguing all of these titles here, we will focus on nine
					of the major films.
				</p>
				<h3>Prequel Trilogy</h3>

				<h3>Sequel Trilogy</h3>

				</ol>
				<p>
					Read more on the <a href="sequel.html" target="_blank">Sequel Trilogy page</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Episode Viewing Order</h3>
				<p>
					There is a lot of debate surrounding what the best viewing
					order is. This is due to the fact that the series was
					theatrically released in media res, or ‘in the middle’ of
					the story.
				</p>
				<p>
					We suggest starting with Episode IV: A New Hope as a litmus
					test for whether or not you will enjoy Star Wars. This is
					because it closely follows the monomyth, or Joseph
					Campbell’s the hero’s journey, and works as a self-contained
					story.

				<h2>The Holiday Special</h2>
				<p>
					The Star Wars Holiday Special is a 97 minute television
					variety show that has achieved a certain cult status with
					fans. While the special was never officially released on
					video, bootleg version have been in circulation for years.
				</p>
				<p>
					George Lucas, the original creator and director for the
					series, famously tried (and failed) to buy all of the
					master copies in an attempt to make sure that the special
					was never broadcast again. Speaking at a convention, Lucas
					famously remarked, “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I
					would track down every bootlegged copy of that programme
					and smash it.”
