				Lest we forget Australia's most devastating loss
			</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					The Great Emu War was a military operation undertaken in
					Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public
					concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in
					the Campion district of Western Australia. While many the
					birds were killed, the emu population persisted and
					continued to cause crop destruction.

				<h2>Prelude to the War</h2>
				<p>
					Following World War I, large numbers of ex-soldiers from
					Australia, along with a number of British veterans, were
					given land by the Australian government to take up farming
					within Western Australia, often in marginal areas. With the
					onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were
					encouraged to increase their wheat crops, with the
					government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in
					the form of subsidies. Despite the recommendations and the
					promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by
					October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the
					farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while
					simultaneously threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat.
				</p>
				<h3>The Enemy Emerges</h3>
				<p>
					The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the
					arrival of as many as 20,000 emus. Emus regularly migrate
					after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the
					inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water
					supplies being made available for livestock by the West
					Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated
					lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm
					territory—in particular the marginal farming land around
					Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus consumed and spoiled the
					crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where
					rabbits could enter and cause further problems.
				</p>
				<h3>Australia Responds</h3>
				<p>
					Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging
					their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to
					meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce.
					Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were
					aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they
					requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed,
					although with conditions attached:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the guns were to be used by military personnel</li>
					<li>troop transport was to be financed by the Western
						Australian government</li>
					<li>the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and
						payment for the ammunition</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Pearce also supported the deployment on the delusional
					grounds that the birds would make good target practice. It
					was not until years later that Pearce admitted he could not
					have possibly predicted the chaos that awaited his forces.
				</p>
				<h3>... Eventually</h3>
				<p>
					Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932. The
					operation was delayed, however, by a period of rainfall
					that caused the emus to scatter over a wider area.
				</p>

				<h2>Chaos on the Battlefield</h2>
				<p>
					The 'war' was conducted under the command of Major G.P.W.
					Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal
					Australian Artillery, with Meredith commanding soldiers
					Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O'Hallora, armed with
					two Lewis guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.
				</p>
				<h3>2 November</h3>
				<p>
					On 2 November, the men travelled to Campion, where some 50
					emus were sighted. However, the birds split into small
					groups and ran so that they were difficult to target. While
					the first fusillade from the machine guns was ineffective
					due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to
					kill "a number" of birds.
				</p>
				<h3>4 November</h3>
				<p>
					The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had
					established an ambush near a local dam, and more than 1,000
					emus were spotted heading towards their position. This
					time, the gunners waited until the birds were in proximity
					before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds
					were killed and the remainder scattered before any more
					could be shot. No more birds were sighted that day.
				</p>
				<h3>6 November</h3>
				<p>
					By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted
					that "each pack seems to have its own leader now – a big
					black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and
					keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of
					destruction and warns them of our approach." (See figure
					below.)

				</figure>
				<p>
					At one stage Meredith even went so far as to mount one of
					the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective,
					as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride
					was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots.
				</p>
				<h3>8 November</h3>
				<p>
					By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500
					rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds
					killed is uncertain: one account estimates that it was 50
					birds.
				</p>
				<p>
					That day, Pearce withdrew the military personnel and the
					guns.

				<h2>Aftermath</h2>
				<p>
					Summarising the culls, ornithologist Dominic Serventy
					commented:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						The machine-gunners' dreams of point-blank fire into
						serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu
						command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and
						its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small
						units that made use of the military equipment
						uneconomic. A crestfallen field force therefore
						withdrew from the combat area after about a month.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					After the withdrawal, Major Meredith commented on the
					striking manoeuvrability of the emus, even while badly
					wounded.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying
					capacity of these birds it would face any army in the
					world... They can face machine guns with the
					invulnerability of tanks.
				</blockquote>
