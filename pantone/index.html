			Pantone 448 C, also known as the "The ugliest colour in the world",
			is a colour in the Pantone colour system. Described as a "drab dark
			brown", it was selected in 2016 as the colour for plain tobacco and
			cigarette packaging in Australia, after market researchers
			determined that it was the least attractive colour.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Australian Department of Health initially referred to the
			colour as "olive green", but the name was changed after concerns
			were expressed by the Australian Olive Association.

			Since 2016, the same colour has also been used for plain cigarette
			packaging in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Norway,
			New Zealand, Slovenia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

		<h2>Hue Have To Be Kidding Me</h2>

			It's become something of a phenomenon in the colour world. Google
			"Pantone 448 C," and mixed in among the news stories about its use
			in packaging are plenty of impassioned defenses, like
